/**
Debouncing is a similar strategy to throttling (see yui-throttle)

Y.debounce delays the execution of a function by a certain number
of milliseconds, starting over every time the function is called.
That way it allows you to listen only once to events happening
repeated times over a time span.

For example, you can debounce a callback to a keypress event
so that you know when the user stopped typing:
```
Y.one('input').on('click', Y.debounce(500, function () {
    alert('The user stopped typing');
}));
```
