gallery-datatable-paginator
============

This module is a class extension of `Y.DataTable` that adds support for paginated data, working in concert with the gallery-paginator-view class.  

It supports several new attributes on DataTable, mostly related to defining a PaginatorView instance.

The module works with both client-side Pagination (where data is either defined locally OR where the initial data payload comes from a remote source) and server-side Pagination.

It also works with scrolling and sorting DataTable.

Please see the [YUI Gallery DataTable-Paginator](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/datatable-paginator) page for information and access to the API Docs.
