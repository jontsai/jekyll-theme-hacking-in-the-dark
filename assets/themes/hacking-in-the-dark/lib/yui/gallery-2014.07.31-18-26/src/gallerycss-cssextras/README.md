Pure Extras
===========

Simple CSS for all those common UI elements that a web application needs. Built on the [Pure](http://purecss.io) CSS framework.


Install
--------

Pure Extras is a set of CSS rules that makes it easier to create common UI components for the web. It is available through **Bower**:

    bower install pure-extras

It's also available through the [YUI Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/), under the name `gallerycss-cssextras`. Take a look at the [examples and docs](http://tilomitra.github.com/cssextras/).


What about older browsers?
--------------------------

Since it's all CSS, nothing breaks in older browsers. This module is tested on IE6+, Chrome, FF and Safari. For best results, use IE8+. IE6 and 7 have some minor vertical alignment issues.
