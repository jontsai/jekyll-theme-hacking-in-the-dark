    <title>The Flyweigth Pattern</title>
  </head>

    <h1>The Flyweight Pattern</h1>
    <p>Some objects manage large number of items. If those items are
      complex objects themselves, such as subclasses of <code>Base</code>,
      the memory consumed by such a collection can take your application
      down. However, with a large number of items, you are rarely going
      to actually deal with all of those items at once, you don't need
      the to be active all the time. This is when the Flyweight pattern
      comes handy. The name doesn't mean much to me, I prefer to think
      of it as a Sliding Window kind of thing, where you slide a small
      window cut in a piece of paper over the data so that you actually
      see a little bit of it at a time. </p>
    <p> For several years now, YUI 3 has been lacking a TreeView which
      was one of the very earliest widgets in YUI 2 and the reason is
      simple, the formal way to construct such a widget would be to use
      <code> Widget</code> for the root augmented by <code>WidgetParent</code>
      and a <code>Widget</code> for each node in the tree, each
      augmented by <code>WidgetChild</code> and, if they have children,
      <code>WidgetParent</code>. This is a terribly costly way of doing
      it, the browser soon starts running out of memory, becomes
      sluggish and eventually freezes with trees far short of big. </p>
    <p> The Flyweight pattern gives us an alternative. Each node is
      actually composed of the state and the behavior. The state is made
      of things like the label it shows, whether it is expanded or
      collapsed, selected or not and which nodes are its children. The
      behavior is what to do when things change. In OOP we learn that
      objects are made of those two aspects put together. As it turns
      out, this is terribly expensive. What we do instead is to have the
      state in a plain object, without methods, attributes or events,
      simple property:value sets, and put all the behavior, that is
      methods and events, in a separate object. This object provides us
      the window which allows us to look at the state of any node at any
      time. </p>
    <p>If we were to have one object handling the behavior for each item
      in the collection we would be just as bad as having a <code>Widget</code>
      instance per node. Going back to our paper cutout, it would be as
      having the paper weakened with too many wholes. What we do instead
      is try to have a few behavior objects as we can possibly can.</p>
    <p> I had already explored this in my own <a
        href="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/md-model">Gallery Model</a>
      module, where the base Model could be augmented by the
      MultiRecordModel extension which allowed the same Model to handle
      any number of records that slid under the single Model instance.
      This allowed the same Model to handle one or multiple records. The
      Model provided the window into the data and the <code>MultiRecordModel</code>
      extension managed the sliding of the data under it. </p>
    <h2>The Flyweight Tree Manager and the Flyweight TreeView </h2>
    <p>For a TreeView, I needed to add a second dimension since, unlike
      a list which is uni-dimensional, a tree has depth. However, a
      TreeView is not the only widget that relies on tree-structured
      data, a Menu also does and so can a form, made of several nested
      groupings of fields, field-sets, groups of radio buttons and other
      arbitrary groupings. So, the <code>Widget</code> is split into
      two parts, the <a
        href="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/flyweight-tree">FlyweightTreeManager,





      </a>which handles the tree-like structure, and the actual <a
        href="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/fwt-treeview">FWTreeView</a>
      widget, which shows the tree data as a TreeView. Though originally
      I made the <code>FlyweightTreeManager</code> as an extension to
      avoid limiting to a <code>Widget</code>, I found that the
      generalization had a cost in code size and the abstraction made
      little sense. Thus, <code>FlyweightTreeManager</code> is a
      subclass of <code>Widget</code>. </p>
    <p>The <code>FlyweightTreeManager</code> is not the window, the
      paper cutout showing the data through, but it manages the windows
      over the plain data underneath. The sliding windows are instances
      of <code>FlyweightTreeNode</code>, a subclass of <code>Base</code>.
      The manager deals with moving these windows around the data. The
      manager is also a factory of node instances, they should not be
      created independently. This allows the manager to limit the number
      of instances created at any time to the minimum. </p>
    <p>The manager has a pool of node instances and it borrows them from
      the pool when needed, and refills the pool when empty. The pool
      can be quite small. The number of items in the pool hardly ever
      exceeds the depth of the tree. A fully collapsed tree will require
      just two instances for rendering, one for the root and one for
      each node in turn (the manager gets an instance for the root and
      then the enumerating method uses a single instance for each node
      being drawn). If the tree is expanded one node at a time, the same
      two nodes will be used over and over, one for the node being
      expanded and the other to render each child. Rendering a fully
      expanded tree would require a node instance per level. </p>
    <p>Since the information at each level might be different, nodes can
      be of different types. The manager recognizes the <code>type</code>
      attribute and keeps separate pools for each kind of node. Thus,
      the pool is a hash indexed by node type, with each entry an array
      of pooled nodes. </p>
    <p>To create the tree, the constructor receives an array of plain
      objects defining the first level of nodes, containing properties
      such as <code>label</code>, <code>expanded</code>, <code>type</code>
      or <code>children</code>, the later being an array of further
      objects defining the next level of nodes. </p>
    <h2>Moving about</h2>
    <p>To traverse the tree, the manager provides the <code>forSomeNodes</code>
      method, which loops through all of the nodes in the tree, depth
      first, passing each node to the callback in turn. The method
      assumes the node instance will not be used beyond the lifespan of
      the callback and returns the node to pool at every step. If there
      are different node types, it will provide a suitable instance for
      each node. As its name suggest ('some' instead of 'each') the
      traversal can be cancelled at any time. A full traversal will
      require a number of nodes equal to the depth of the tree, assuming
      all the nodes of the same type. For finer control over the
      traversal <code>FlyweightTreeNode</code> also provides a <code>forSomeChildren</code>
      method that lets you go one level at a time. For example, the <code>render</code>
      method does not use <code>forSomeNodes</code> since it doesn't
      bother to render the whole tree, just the expanded branches. Thus,
      it uses <code>forSomeChildren</code> one level at a time, when
      needed. </p>
    <p>What happens when you want to keep a reference to a node? Each
      node has a <code>hold</code> method which keeps the node away
      from the pool. The developer should use <code>hold</code>
      sparingly as this increases memory. When done with the node,
      calling <code>release</code> will return it to the pool. Several
      <code>get<i>Xxxx</i></code> methods (<code>getParent</code>, <code>getNextSibling</code>,
      <code>getNodeBy</code>) return node references. Unlike the
      traversal methods (<code>forSomeNodes</code>, <code>forSomeChildren</code>),
      the manager cannot predict when you are done with the requested
      node, thus, those nodes are automatically placed on hold for you.
    </p>
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>Event listeners are also provided with node instances. You can
      listen to any DOM events by delegation at the root. The manager
      will supplement the event facade for such events with an extra <code>node</code>
      property containing a reference to the node that received the
      event (in fact, the node that would have received the event had it
      been there, but the manager makes it all look like it has always
      been there). The node instances provided to the event facade are
      returned to the pool when the event has run its course. Once
      again, the developer can call <code>hold</code> to keep that
      reference and call <code>release</code> when it is no longer
      needed. </p>
    <p>What happens with events at the node level? DOM events can be
      listened to by delegation at the root. You can listen to them at
      the node level but that would require you to place the node
      instance on hold. If a node needs to respond itself to a DOM
      event, all it needs to do is add the type of event to a list kept
      by the manager so that when the event fires, the manager will take
      an instance from the pool and relay it the event as if it had
      always been there. <code>FWTreeNode</code> does this with the <code>"click"</code>
      event so that it can respond to clicks by toggling expansion or
      selection. For internal node events, such as attribute change
      events, since the attribute must be changed from within the
      instance itself (by using the <code>set</code> method), any such
      events will fire while the instance is already active. </p>
    <p>The manager also handles dynamic loading, a feature much
      appreciated in YUI2 TreeView. If a function is set on the <code>dynamicLoader</code>
      attribute, the first time a collapsed node is expanded, the
      dynamic loader will be called. The loader will get a reference to
      the node being expanded and a callback function. Whenever it
      manages to get the new nodes, it must call the callback function
      passing the array of new nodes to add to the tree. Along the
      examples of <a
        href="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/fwt-treeview">gallery-fwt-treeview</a>
      there is one showing this feature, extracting information from YQL
      every time a node is expanded. All the example uses just four
      nodes, no matter how many nodes are shown and each is of a
      different type (one default type for the root, which is invisible
      and one of a different type for each level). </p>
    <p>There is another throughback to YUI 2 TreeView. All rendering is
      done via templates. A big string containing the markup is build
      for the expanded sections of the tree and then inserted into the <code>innerHTML</code>
      of the overall container for the tree in a single action. TreeView
      was the only widget in the YUI 2 family that did it this way, most
      of them use <code>YAHOO.util.Element</code> and do quite a lot of
      DOM manipulation. TreeView simply concatenated lots of tiny bits
      and pieces of strings, without any templates, just one bit a time.
      Once it was expected that DOM manipulation would eventually see
      great performance improvements and doing DOM manipulation seemed
      better than concatenating strings, however, the opposite turned
      out to be true. Thus, an old part of an old widget turned out to
      be better than later improvements. </p>
    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>Now, as for memory consumption, drawing a tree using a <code>Widget</code>
      per node, each augmented with <code>WidgetChild</code> an <code>WidgetParent</code>,
      takes 8 times the memory than using the <code>FWTreeView</code>
      when drawing a tree with about 150 nodes. The pure <code>Widget</code>
      solution grows in proportion to the depth times the width of the
      tree (this is not strictly true since the tree is not a square, in
      fact it grows with exponentialy with the depth of the tree, the
      exponent being the number of children per node). <code>FWTreeView</code>
      grows linearly with the depth. Thus, with more nodes, the
      difference grows even sharper. Adding just one more level of nodes
      to the tree made the browser crash with the <code>Widget</code>
      based solution while <code>FWTreeView</code> kept working fine. </p>
    <p>All this savings would be expected to come at a cost, after all,
      managing the pool and sliding those cutout windows around should
      take time. As a matter of fact, the cost of managing the nodes is
      barely noticeable for very small trees. For larger trees, the cost
      to the browser of managing the huge amounts of memory required by
      the Widget-based solution completely overwhelms the browser. For
      the same 150 nodes, the performance of <code>FWTreeView</code>
      was 12 times faster. I was unable to measure it for a tree one
      level deeper because Firefox froze and Chrome crashed with the
      Widget-based tree while it kept working with <code>FWTreeView</code>.
      (I wasn't adding one node at a time but one full level at a time
      so after the 156 nodes it went to 781 nodes, growing exponentially
      with each level). </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The flyweight pattern allows managing large number of nodes with
      ease, minimizing memory consumption and, indirectly, improving
      performance by taking less resources from the browser. It can be
      argued (and has been argued) that <code>Base</code> and <code>Widget</code>
      are too heavy, and there is some truth to it. One solution is to
      avoid using them. Another is to use them wisely, which is the
      option shown here.</p>
    <p> This article has described mostly the <code>FlyweightTreeManager</code>
      object though developers are more likely to use <code>FWTreeView</code>,
      which inherits from it. <code>FlyweightTreeManager</code> can be
      instantiated and rendered, but it has no CSS styles and the
      templates are very basic so the resulting HTML is boring, it
      should be considered an abstract class. <code>FWTreeView</code>
      ads several features such as node selection and keyboard
      navigation. These are not provided by the base abstract classes
      because each widget (treeview, menu, form) handles them
      differently. WAI-ARIA support is built-in. </p>
