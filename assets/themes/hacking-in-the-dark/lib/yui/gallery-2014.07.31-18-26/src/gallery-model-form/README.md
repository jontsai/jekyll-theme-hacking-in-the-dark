gallery-model-form
========
This will be a yui module that will make forms a bit smarter, by attaching a Y.Model instance to the form inputs and doing two-update updates of both the input elements and the Y.Model instance as changes are made. The gallery-model-form will also support all of the Model change events that you've grown to love.
