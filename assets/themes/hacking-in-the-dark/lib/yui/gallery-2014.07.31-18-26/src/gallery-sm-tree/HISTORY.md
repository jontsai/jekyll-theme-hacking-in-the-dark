SmugMug Tree History
====================

## git

* Arbitrary properties in the `config` object passed to `Tree.Node`'s
  constructor are now mixed into the instance, allowing you to attach your own
  metadata or methods to nodes. Arbitrary config properties cannot overwrite
  properties that already exist on the node or its prototype.

## 2013-01-09

* Moved the open/close/toggle functionality into a new
  `gallery-sm-tree-openable` extension.

## 2012-12-26

* Initial gallery release.
