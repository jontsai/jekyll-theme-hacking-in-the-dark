/**
Wraps the execution of synchronous or asynchronous operations, providing a
promise object that can be used to subscribe to the various ways the operation
may terminate.

When the operation completes successfully, call the Deferred's `resolve()`
method, passing any relevant response data for subscribers.  If the operation
encounters an error or is unsuccessful in some way, call `reject()`, again
passing any relevant data for subscribers.

The Deferred object should be shared only with the code resposible for
resolving or rejecting it. Public access for the Deferred is through its
_promise_, which is returned from the Deferred's `promise()` method. While both
Deferred and promise allow subscriptions to the Deferred's state changes, the
promise may be exposed to non-controlling code. It is the preferable interface
for adding subscriptions.

Subscribe to state changes in the Deferred with the promise's
`then(callback, errback)` method.  `then()` wraps the passed callbacks in a
new Deferred and returns the corresponding promise, allowing chaining of
asynchronous or synchronous operations. E.g.
`promise.then(someAsyncFunc).then(anotherAsyncFunc)`
