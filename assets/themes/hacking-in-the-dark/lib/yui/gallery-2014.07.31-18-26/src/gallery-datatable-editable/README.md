gallery-datatable-editable
============

This module is a class extension of `Y.DataTable` that adds the support ATTRS and events onto a DT instance to support cellediting (via gallery-datatable-celleditor-xxxxx modules) and hopefully future support for row editing (via a future gallery-datatable-roweditor-xxx set of modules).

It supports the following new attributes on DataTable;
* editable
* editOpenType
* defaultEditor

In addition this module adds recognition to the following new Column definition object properties;
* editor
* editable 
* editorConfig
